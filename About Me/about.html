            <p>Hi, my name is Charran Thangeswaran!<br><br> 
                From an early age, I found myself intrigued by computers. My journey into the world of computers began as a mere curiosity and has since developed into a strong passion that fuels my every endeavour.<br><br> 
                I strive to use my skills and knowledge to develop impactful solutions and contribute to our technology-driven world. With an innovative mindset and a commitment to lifelong learning, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.<br><br> 
                I am always open to connecting and collaborating with people, so if you are interested in learning more about me, please feel free to check my <a href="Docs/Charran Thangeswaran Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> out. You can also take a look at some of my projects out and reach out to me.<br><br></p>
